    <h1>Croissant</h1>
    <p>A croissant is a buttery, flaky French pastry, typically crescent-shaped, made from a laminated yeast-leavened dough. It is a type of Viennoiserie, a category of pastries that bridges the gap between bread and puff pastry. The pastry's defining characteristic is its layers of dough and butter, which create its signature airy and crisp texture.</p>
